When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want to work remotely or collaborate with others
-------------------------------------
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It might create a conflict. The most recent version is not hte most statble version
