When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want to work remotely or collaborate with others
-------------------------------------
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It might create a conflict. The most recent version is not hte most statble version
------------------------------------
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

the branch is when you want to deviate from the existing code and test something. The clone is when you want to copy a repository to another place and the fork is the clone that you have not permission to modify the original repository
